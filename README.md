# üç¶ Soft Secret

Inject client-side tokens (public access token, anon api keys, client ids) into a file for the build step. **DO NOT use with server-side keys or private secrets.**

## Why?

1. Developers want to keep config separated from the code.
2. Rotating a client tokens/ids/keys should not require a source code push.
3. Make it easier to reuse the same application code for a new project.

This action allows developer to store their configuration in a remote file, in a github secret, or in the action declaration itself (CI layer).

## Security through obscrurity?

Not the case. The client-side tokens/public keys mentioned here were meant to be bundled into the client software anyway. Examples include OAuth client ids, tracking ids, anonymous api tokens, etc...

If you need to store private keys/secret and you are building a server application, use a secret store.

## Disclaimer

**It is your responsibility for leaked secrets and credentials. Please audit this action closely before deploying it to production to ensure it is not tampering with your keys.**

## Usage

Specify a secret, and a target path to write the secret to. The path is relative to the root of the workflow environment, which for most case would be the root of your project. You can nest it as much as needed, as any missing path will be created for you:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PlasmoHQ/soft-secret@v1
    with:
      secret: ${{ secrets.TEST }}
      target: "core/test/key.ts"
```

You can also host the keys in a publicly accessible location, and specify a `fetch` argument. This will let the action know to treat secret as an url, and fetch it:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: PlasmoHQ/soft-secret@v1
    with:
      secret: https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/soft-secret/releases/download/test/key.json
      target: "deep/path/key.json"
      fetch: "true"
```

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for more details about arguments and their aliases.
